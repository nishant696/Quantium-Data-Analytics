## Project Description
The project involves the following key tasks:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
- Data Preprocessing and Cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Feature Engineering to create relevant features for analysis and modeling.
- Data Visualization to present insights and findings effectively.
- Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing to validate assumptions and make data-driven decisions.
- Machine Learning Modeling to predict customer behavior and optimize marketing strategies.
- Report Generation to document findings, recommendations, and insights.

## Dataset
The dataset provided by Quantium includes transactional data for retail stores, including information on customer demographics, product purchases, and store locations. It consists of multiple CSV files containing different aspects of the data.

## Requirements
The project requires the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or any other Python IDE
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels
- Plotly (optional, for advanced data visualization)

## Installation
To set up the project environment, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install Python 3.x if not already installed.
3. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
